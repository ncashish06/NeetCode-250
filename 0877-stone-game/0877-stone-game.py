    # Game Strategy: When it is your turn, do your best and choose maximum. Since opponent also plays optimally, expect the worst from result after opponent's turn. So it is alternating max->min->max->min... structure of the recursion, i.e., classic minimax: maximize on your turn, minimize (from your perspective) on the opponent's turn
