        The key insight: always compare with nums[right].
        If nums[mid] > nums[right], the rotation (and thus the minimum) is to the RIGHT.
        Otherwise, the minimum is to the LEFT (including mid itself).
        Keep mid as a candidate (it could be the minimum), so don't do right = mid - 1
