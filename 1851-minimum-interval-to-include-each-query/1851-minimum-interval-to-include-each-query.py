        Key idea: process queries in increasing order, and only "activate"
        intervals whose left endpoint is <= current query. Use a min-heap
        keyed by (size, right) so the smallest valid interval is always on top.
        Lazily remove intervals from the heap once their right endpoint
        can no longer cover the current (or any future, larger) query.
